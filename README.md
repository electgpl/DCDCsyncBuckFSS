# High-Performance Synchronous Buck Converter Module (AP64501)

This project is the design of a **DC-DC buck regulator module** based on the **AP64501**.  
It is mechanically and electrically compatible with the popular **LM2596-based low-cost Chinese modules**, using the same form factor, size, and pinout.  
However, this design provides **significant improvements** in terms of efficiency, thermal performance, EMI, and reliability.
